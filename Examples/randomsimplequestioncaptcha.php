    * If you use these classes inside another namespace (fe ProcessWire) like in this case, you have to take care about the namespace in front of the class instances.
    * Fe you have to use $form = new \FrontendForms\Form('myForm'); or $form = new FrontendForms\Form('myForm'); and not only $form = new Form('myForm');
